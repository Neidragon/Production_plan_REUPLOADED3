# Production Plan
(Attempt number 3 of reuploading Production Plan presentation) Presentation about the steps to follow in order to understand and develop a production plan to optimize everything. By Hèctor Garcia Pérez, GDDV UPC, Barcelona.

## Definition
- A production plan is a document that outlines the strategies, procedures, and resources needed to achieve specific manufacturing or operational goals. It typically includes details such as production schedules, inventory requirements, equipment maintenance, and workforce allocation. The plan serves as a blueprint for ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively to meet production targets while minimizing costs and maximizing profitability.

## Steps to follow

## Planing:

* What's the main idea of our game
* What type of game/product will it be?
* What kind of audience are we targeting?
* Specifications: Stuff, Equipment, Cost (prediction), etc

Once it's all planned, we can jump to the next step.

## Pre-Production:

The next step in our project is to take all of the information we've gathered and put it in some order. This will ensure that we can easily access and use the information as we move forward. To achieve this, we'll keep everything in a single document, making it easy to reference when needed. It's important that this document is clear and concise, with all of the information listed in a logical and structured way. We also need to make sure that we list all of the factors that we thought about later, to ensure that nothing is missed and our plan is as comprehensive as possible. By doing this, we can be confident that we have a solid foundation for our project and are well-prepared for the next steps. The most optimal way to organize it will be through a production plan (p.p.)

In this example we can see the structure to follow, we see that it is divided into different "phases", which we can see how they "answer" some questions we might have raised at this point.

With the production plan and the path all more clear, we can go to "How no to mess with the Law" and start talking about coopyright and licenses.

## Production:

There are several layers of "legality" that must be overcome when producing any material, not just video games. In our case we will face it in the form of copyright licenses among others.

When talking about producing something we have to do it under some a company, affiliated group or similar. Not just for making it formerly legal but also to take advantage of some "privileges" that as a bussines we owe.

As a bussines entity we can:

* Take advantage of certain tax benefits a.k.a. save money while producing.
* In case of tragedy having protection can serve as a safeguard for the business proprietor and their employees, shielding them from potential legal actions.
* Protecting intellectual property (IP).
* Helping keep the rights of own created material.
* Improve the image of our product. 

Another important step will be how to own our material and create the copyright and IPs needed. Depending on the country, the method may vary (there will be some links on the bibliography that will lead pages specialized in intellectual property) but will have to take somethings in consideration first:

* We’ll have to face copyright in order to register our own IP.
* A very long bureaucratic process.
* Once defined, we are finally able to place our own trademark.

A trademark is a legally protected symbol, word, phrase, design, or combination of these that is used to identify and distinguish the goods or services of one person or company from those of others. It serves as a unique identifier and helps consumers recognize and remember a particular brand or product. Trademarks can be registered with the government and give the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with their goods or services, and to prevent others from using a similar mark that could cause confusion among consumers.

The penultimate step will be entirely aimed at polishing the product (game in this case) and fixing errors or "bugs" that it may present

## Pre-release:

Playtesting will be crucial to ensure its quality and entertainment value. Deploying a beta version, whether closed or open, allows players to test the game and provide feedback. The focus during this stage should be on correcting flaws and bugs that may affect the gameplay experience. After the necessary improvements have been made, the media gets involved. 

This stage involves marketing and generating hype for the game, building anticipation for its official release. By following these steps, developers can ensure that their game is polished, enjoyable, and ready for the market.

## Final Release:

As we approach the final stages of development, it's essential to establish a release date for our product. This final release date will set a deadline for the team to work towards and ensure that all necessary components are ready for launch. To measure the success of our product, we need to define metrics that will help us assess its performance. These metrics can include total downloads, positive and negative reviews, and total revenue generated over a specific period, whether it be a week, month, or year. By establishing these basic goals, we can evaluate our product's success and make necessary final adjustments to improve its performance.

In the world of gaming, there are various ways developers can offer additional content to players. Depending on the type of game, developers can add an extra "step" that is commonly known as PUSH. This extra step can come in the form of premium content, such as additional characters or items, that players can purchase to enhance their gaming experience. Another way developers offer extra content is through "Games as a Service" such as Destiny, which allows for continuous updates and new features to be added to the game over time.

Additionally, DLC (Downloadable Content) and expansions can also be added to games to provide players with new storylines, areas to explore, and more. These methods allow for players to continue to enjoy their favorite games long after they have completed the original content.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, creating a production plan is a crucial step in ensuring the success of any project. By following the steps outlined in this presentation, you can create a production plan that is realistic, achievable, and tailored to your specific needs. It is important to plan smartly and not rush things, as this will help you avoid costly mistakes and delays. Additionally, keeping your licenses up to date is crucial to ensure that you are legally compliant and avoid any potential legal issues. By keeping these important factors in mind, you can create a production plan that sets you up for success and helps you achieve your goals efficiently and effectively.
